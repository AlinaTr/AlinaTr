### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alina from Romania, and I'm a Software Tester. I am really passionate about learning new techniques and frameworks used in software testing. I am also learning Python, Java, and SQL. My goal is to take my knowledge to the next level, and continuously learn and improve to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
